                <p>The top layer of a Linux system is the applications which it can run. These applications can range from command line
                programs like vim or gui based programs.</p>

                <p>Upper level programs exist solely for the convenience of the user. They are simply ways of inputting and displaying data in a manner which is agreeable to people.
                All data seen and inputted into high level applications is processed by both the kernel and shell. The major upside to applications is that they allow the user a 
                large amount of control over how operations are carried by their machines.</p>
                <p>Lower level programs, or utilities, like vim are more dificlut for the layman to use but are generally far more powerfull than gui based programs. These utilities 
                tend to provided extreme levels of control over the system and can even be used to rewrite permissions or system files. The utilites are run almost exclusively on the shell's cli 
                but are not technically a part of the shell itself.</p>
