                <p>The shell is the most basic form of communiction between a user and their machine. The shell is sperate from the Linux kernel and comes in various different forms (sh, csh, bash, ksh, etc.).
                At first glance, the shell appears to simply be a command line interface(cli).</p>

                <p>Simply saying that the shell is a command line is doing it a great disservice. The shell acts as the interpreter for both the kernel and the user.
                While the kernel translates information from the computer's hardware, this information needs to be further translated for  the user.
                The shell can take this information and translate it in a manner which will make sense to the user.
                The shell can also take commands from the user and translate them back down to a language which the kernel can understand. 
                The kernel can then translate any given command into information that the computer hardware can understand.</p>
                <p>In summation, the shell acts as a translator to and from the kernel.</p>
