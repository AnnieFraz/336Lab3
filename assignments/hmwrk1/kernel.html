                <p>Technically speaking. the kernel is the only part of the operating system which is Linux. All Linux  based systems are running on the Linux kernel.
                Linux is simply a catch all term for operating systems(Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu, etc.) that run on the Linux kernel.</p>
                <h2>What is a Kernel?</h2> <br />
                
           
                
                <p>The kernel is the core of the operating system. The main purpose of the kernel is to communicate with a computer's hardware. The kernel handles low level tasks and is generally 
                limited to a few functions (read, write, close). These low level functions have to do with the type of memory mangement associated with processing address space.</p>
                <p>To put it simply, the kernel "talks" to the hardware and returns low-level data which is mostly meaningless to a user, but can be interpreted and then used.</p>
                <p>This interpretation happens within the next section of a Linux operating system: the shell.</p>
