                <p>If you have come to this website, it means that you know little to nothing about Linux.</p>
                <p>The goal of this website is to give the layman a rudimentary understanding of what Linux is.</p>
                <p>At a basic level, Linux is an operating system. However, Linux is made up of primarily three different sections: the kernel, the shell, and the system's utilities.
                The wide selection of variations on these individual parts is what allows Linux to  be an incredibly versatile system. For simplicity's sake, however,
                this website will only go over the basic abilities of each section.</p>
